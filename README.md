# web-status
Checks if a website is online from the terminal every 10 seconds

To use:
1. Save this code in your favorite editor as "filename.js"
2. Use node JS
3. install xhr2
4. type "node filename.js" and watch the terminal for online status


Note: eventually this will be integrated with a third-party to provide text or email notifications
